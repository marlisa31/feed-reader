## Overview
The goal of this project was to get familiar with unit testing, and the Jasmine framework in particular. The precise task was to write several test suites that make sure the functionalities of the already existing "UdaciFeeds Website" work properly.


## How to run the application

The application can be run by downloading and deploying it. To run the SpecRunner, open the index.html file in the root folder. Tests are written in the feedreader.js document which can be found in the jasmine > spec folder. In addition a GitHub page was prepared which shows the SpecRunner (index.html).
