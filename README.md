## Overview
The goal of this project was to get familiar with unit testing as well as the Jasmine framework in particular. The precise task was to write several test suites that make sure the functionalities of the already existing "UdaciFeeds Website" work properly. Tests are mainly done on the toggle functionality of the menu and on the loading behavior of the Google Feed Reader API which was used to implement the UdaciFeeds.


## How to run the application

The application can be run by downloading and deploying it. To run the SpecRunner, open the index.html file in the root folder. Functionalities are written in js > app.js whereas tests are written in the feedreader.js document which is located in the jasmine > spec folder. In addition a GitHub page was prepared which shows the SpecRunner (index.html).
